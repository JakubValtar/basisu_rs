# basisu_rs

I'm writing a [Basis Universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) decoder in Rust to learn more about compression and optimization through [learning in public](https://www.mentalnodes.com/the-only-way-to-learn-in-public-is-to-build-in-public).

The code is WIP and not fit for any practical purpose.
